# This script has two modes:
# 1. if the environment variable COVER is set to YES, the test cases are
#    called as is, but before each test case, the environment variables of
#    gcov are set to store all coverage data of the executable in a newly
#    created directory. The data is not yet processed - this is done by
#    other Makefile targets.
#
# 2. otherwise, the given executable is called without code coverage tool


# evaluate COVER variable
case $COVER in
  "YES")
    # derive test name from current directory (assuming GNU Autotest); the
    # info filename is suffixed with a random number to allow for multiple
    # invokations of this script for the same test
    dir=`pwd`
    TESTNAME=`basename $dir`
