IBM BUSINESS PROCESS MODELS
===========================

About
-----

* Added by: Niels Lohmann <niels.lohmann@uni-rostock.de>
* Original source: IBM Zurich Research Lab
* Net type:
  * Workflow nets
  * Free Choice
* Format: LoLA low-level nets, translated by UML2oWFN


Notes
-----

* The models have been anonymized library by library. Names within library B1
  hence have no meaning in library B2.
* Each net has two LoLA task files. One for checking weak termination using
  LIVEPROP and one for checking safeness using STATEPREDICATE.


Soundness Check
---------------

1. Check for weak termination:

    lola-bpm-liveprop1 net.lola -anet.lola.fin.task

2. Check for safeness:

    lola-bpm-statepredicate1 net.lola -anet.lola.safe.task

The LoLA binaries can be created by

    make lola-bpm-liveprop1 lola-bpm-statepredicate1

inside LoLA's directory.


Liveness Check
--------------

Liveness was checked after connecting the output place
via a new transition to the input place by the tool
Anastasia, using the command line

    anastasia net.lola --lola --loopnet --swomt --witness

* 590 nets were found live
* 796 nets were found non-live

Results for each net and a firing sequence emptying a
siphon in the non-live case can be found in anastasia.zip.


Statistics
----------

* 1386 nets
* 66379 places (average: 47, minimum: 4, maximum: 273)
* 44623 transitions (average: 32, minimum: 3, maximum: 284)
* 132432 arcs (average: 95, minimum: 6, maximum: 572)
