fms_attic is a different version of FMS whose provenance is unfortunately unknown.

ping pong is a PN model for an asynchronous program (stemming from some tests with M. Emmi).

The bingham_h examples are *contrived* examples whose description is given in
J. Bingham, INFINITY'04. They show some weaknesses of our approach especially
of our data structure which does not scale too well with nets with many places.
Also it shows that ic4pn does not perform well because it has to refine until
almost all places are separated.

On a positive note, bingham_h250_attic has a different target from bingham_h250. 
On this example ic4pn terminates with 10 variables.
